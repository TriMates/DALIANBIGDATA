# DALIANBIGDATA
This is a demo for our experiment on the mnist dataset, which achieves the 100% performance for all of the four clustering measures: ACC, NMI, F1-Score and RandIndex. The whole code will be presented after the paper has been accepted.

Test the model by test_score.py

# install the pytorch 
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
